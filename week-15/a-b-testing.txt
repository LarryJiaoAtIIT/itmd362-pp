# Production Problem 9: A/B Testing on the Cheap

## The Problem

Locate an interface component on some website that you use frequently that you think could be improved. The improvement should be minor, as we discussed in class.

Take a screenshot of the interface on both a mobile and desktop device. Then, sketch or illustrate your alternate/"b" test. Finally, describe modification and the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write in order to conduct the test.

## Deliverables

* Screenshots of the interface component on mobile and desktop, placed in this directory (`week-15`)
	-	ocremix-1.png
	-	ocremix-2.png
* Sketch or illustrate (e.g., in Photoshop) your alternate/"b" test, placed in this directory (`week-15`)
	-	B-Testing.png/psd
* A text description of the modification, and a description of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write for the test (you do *not* have to write the actual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, however)
	
	A lot of the design has mostly been done as early as when this webpage has been online, and has
	mostly been revised to fit the needs for active people who frequent on the webpage. (Referring to
	Ohgodwhy.png) Much of the styling is being done while the HTML is loaded, but not in a separate
	CSS file; it is all checked through under the HTML source.
	
	There does seem to be a method to this madness, but it does not seem like it has fully transitioned
	to having an external CSS folder. Meanwhile, Javascript seems to be loading regardless of whether
	it is in the beginning or not, which leads me to believe that perhaps it wasn't a big deal back then.
	
	It is also very plausible that the webpage is being loaded under PHP, mainly looking at the number of
	times "PHP" was requested based on the query I requested. The main thing to look at would probably
	just be the media queries, as it functions well under a desktop environment.
