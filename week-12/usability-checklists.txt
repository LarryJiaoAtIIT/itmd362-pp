# Production Problem 7: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items. Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you've found:

1.	http://www.userfocus.co.uk/resources/homepagechecklist.html
2. http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/user-interface-elements.html

* Your own condensed, ten-item must-have usability checklist:

1. There should not be any "Feature Lists"
2. Depending on the Size, it may need a search bar.
3. The Home Page needs all major options.
4. The Home Page needs a mamorable URL.
5. All corporate/important information is in a defined location
6. A person with the first impressions on a page should not have issue with it.
7. The site map is linked to every page.
8. Hyperlinks should be distinctly labeled by their function.
9. The same login form is used for all types of logging in.
10. Forms are validated before they are submitted.
